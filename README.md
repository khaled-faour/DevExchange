Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [React JS](https://reactjs.org/). React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Mongoose ODM](https://mongoosejs.com) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com).

- To send emails, the app uses the [Nodemailer](nodemailer.com/) package for NodeJS.
